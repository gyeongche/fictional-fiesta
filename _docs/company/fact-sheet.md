    <strong>DuckDuckGo</strong> is a general search engine like Google. We
    differentiate through:

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">Privacy:</a> We don't track our
        users.

    </li>
    <li>
        Simplicity: Less clutter, less spam, fewer ads and an overall cleaner
        design. We can do this since we just focus on web search and therefore don't
        have to promote other services on our results pages.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://dontbubble.us/">No filter bubble:</a> We don’t bias search
        results towards what we think particular users would already agree with.
