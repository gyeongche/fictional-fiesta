    DuckDuckGo generates revenue in two ways, while upholding our

<h2 id="advertising">Advertising</h2>
<p>
    It is a myth that search engines need to track you to make money on Web
    search. When you type in a search, we can show an ad just based on that search
    term. For example, if you type in, "car" we show a car ad. That doesn't
    involve tracking because it is based on the keyword and not the person.
</p>

<p>
    Advertising on DuckDuckGo takes the form of sponsored links that appear above search results. Viewing ads is privacy protected by DuckDuckGo and ad clicks are managed by Microsoft's ad network. They look like this:

<h3 id="howto">How to Advertise on DuckDuckGo</h3>
<p>
    To advertise on DuckDuckGo, please visit <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Advertising</a>. By default, when you sign up for a Microsoft Advertising account, your ads should automatically enter rotation into all of Microsoft Advertising's distribution channels including DuckDuckGo. If you'd like to double-check that
    your ad is set up to run on DuckDuckGo, perform the following:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>When signed in to Bing Ads, click <em>Campaigns</em>.</li>
    <li>Next, click on your campaign's name.</li>
    <li>Then, click on your ad group's name.</li>
    <li>Click the <em>Settings</em> tab.</li>
    <li>Click <em>Ad distribution</em>.</li>
    <li>Then, click <em>Save</em> at the bottom to finalize.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="affiliates">Affiliate Revenue</h2>

<p>
    DuckDuckGo is part of the affiliate programs of the eCommerce websites Amazon
    and eBay. When you visit those sites through DuckDuckGo, including when using
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang">!bangs</a>, and subsequently make a
    purchase, we receive a small commission.
</p>
<p>
    This mechanism operates anonymously and there is no personally identifiable
    information exchanged between us and Amazon or eBay. These links are regular
    organic links (like any other link in our results) and these programs do not
    influence our ranking or relevancy functions in any way. That is, they are not
    advertising like paid placements or paid inclusions, and we only generate
    revenue from them if you ultimately find them relevant enough to end up
    purchasing an item. For more details, check out our
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy#s4">privacy policy</a>.
