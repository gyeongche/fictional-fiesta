<p>
    Ads on DuckDuckGo are supposed to be relevant, helpful, and non-intrusive (if
    not, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/feedback">let us know</a>). Because we're
    a for-profit company, we'd prefer that instead of giving us donations, our
    users support us by allowing ads or by
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/spread">spreading DuckDuckGo</a> to others.
