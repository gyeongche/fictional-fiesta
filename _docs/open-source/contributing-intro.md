        I think I just found an #opensource community that I want to become a part

<h2>Contributing Matters</h2>

<p>
    We know that Wikipedia would always beat out Encarta. We believe that
    DuckDuckGo is an incredible distribution platform for an open-source community
    to change how the web works. We're up against multi-billion-dollar giants -
    and the only way to avoid becoming them is to be inseparable from the
    community.
</p>

<p>
    Our goal is to have
    <strong>85% of queries covered by Instant Answers</strong> (currently this is
    at 19%).
</p>

<h2>Jump Right In</h2>
