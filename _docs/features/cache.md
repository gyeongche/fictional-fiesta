<p>
    We would like to provide cached results ourselves, but unfortunately it is
    non-trivial to do so as it requires a lot of storage.
</p>

<p>
    We do have a !cache <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang">bang</a> that will
    take you to a Google cache result. To use it, just search !cache followed by
    the URL. For example, try the search <em>!cache http://duckduckgo.com/</em>.
</p>

<p>
    To use that easily, you can just copy and paste the URL from a result via your
    browser's' right-click/long tap menu. We are considering offering an easier
    way to do this from the interface.
