<p>
    Category pages are Instant Answers within a particular category, e.g.
    <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/c/The_Simpsons_Characters">The Simpsons Characters</a>. They are often linked to in the <em>Related Topics</em> boxes that appear
    to the right of Instant Answers. They can also be reached directly through
    searches.
</p>

<p>
    While viewing a category page, you can click the grid icon at the top right to
    expand the category entries. Clicking a letter from the list at the top will
    send you to that letter's section of the category.

<p>
    Our category pages are actually automatically generated. That is, we do not
    moderate them directly or manually. Therefore, to add a result to a particular
    category page, you should work to add it to the underlying source. You can
    find the source, e.g. Wikipedia, by clicking on a topic on the category page,
    and then looking for the link in the Instant Answer. If you get the result
    added there (to that specific source) it should auto-flow to us and everyone
    else who draws on that information.
