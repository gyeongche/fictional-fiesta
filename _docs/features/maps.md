You may see a map in your search results if it's particularly relevant to your search terms. For example:

- [*coffee near me*](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=coffee+near+me)
- [*map philadelphia*](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=map+philadelphia)

You can click on a map result to open an interactive map where you can pan, zoom, search, and look up directions. DuckDuckGo map searches and route planning are powered by [Apple's MapKit JS framework](https://developer.apple.com/maps/web/).
