<p>
    If a map is particularly relevant for your search, one will appear
    automatically. (e.g.
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=3+ames+st%2C+02142"><em>3 ames st, 02142</em></a>,
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=map+philadelphia"><em>map philadelphia</em></a>)
</p>

<p>
    Location results will not only give you the option for a map, but also for
    directions. The directions option allows you to choose from the most-requested
    map providers – Apple Maps Google Maps, Bing Maps, HERE Maps, and
    OpenStreetMap. You can select your preferred provider from the dropdown menu,
    and that selected map service will be used every time you click “Get
    Directions.”
</p>

<p>
    DuckDuckGo's maps are interactive. You can pan, zoom, and expand the map
    (click the expand icon at the bottom right of the map).
</p>

<p>
    You can also use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang">!bangs</a> to
    map-search using other search engines right from the DuckDuckGo search box.
    There are !bangs for Google Maps (!gm), Bing Maps (!bm), and Yahoo Maps (!ym).
    For example, <em>!gm 3 ames st, 02142</em> would search for
    <em>3 ames st, 02142</em> on Google Maps. The full list of !bangs are on the
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang">!bang page</a>.
