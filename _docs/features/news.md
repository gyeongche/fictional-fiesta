    If news search results are particularly relevant for your search, they will
    appear automatically. (e.g.
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=weekend+box+office"><em>weekend box office</em></a>)
</p>

<p>
    For some searches, news search results are particularly relevant, but are not
    the best Instant Answer for that search. In those cases, you can get news
    search results by clicking <em>News</em> under the search box. (e.g.
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=philadelphia"><em>philadelphia</em></a>)
</p>

<p>
    If you add the word <em>news</em> to your search, news search results will
    appear automatically no matter the search. (e.g.
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=cat+news"><em>cat news</em></a>)
</p>

<p>
    To expand the news search results, click the grid icon at the top right of the
    news search results. To then collapse the results, click the <em>X</em> icon
    at the top right of the results.
</p>

<p>
    You can also use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang">bangs</a> to search for
    news using other websites right from the DuckDuckGo search box. There are
    bangs for The New York Times (!nyt), The Wall Street Journal (!wsj), and CNN
    (!cnn). For example, <em>!cnn politics</em> would search for
    <em>politics</em> on CNN. The full list of bangs are on the
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang">bang page</a>.
