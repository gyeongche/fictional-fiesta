<p>
    Auto-suggest (also known as autocomplete) is available for DuckDuckGo across
    platforms, including <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">our website</a>,
    <a href="/desktop/adding-duckduckgo-to-your-browser">browser extensions</a>, <a href="/mobile/android">Android app</a> and
    <a href="/mobile/ios">iOS app</a>.
</p>
<p>
    To be clear,
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">we don't collect or share personal information and auto-suggest does not
        impact that at all</a>. We simply do not associate queries with personal information (e.g. IP
    addresses) and in fact don't store any of it at all so our auto-suggest
    doesn't impact your privacy!
