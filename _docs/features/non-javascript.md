    We have two non-JavaScript versions of our search results, which come up
    automatically for some browsers that don't work with the regular JavaScript
    version.

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/html">HTML</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/lite">Lite</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    However, keep in mind that these non-JavaScript sites lack some of the
    features present on the primary site because of its heavy use of JavaScript.
