<h3>Comparing account types</h3>

<p>
    When you register a new account on Duck.co, your account is automatically set
    to Private. Your username will appear as "hidden" to other members and
    visitors of Duck.co and your user page will not be accessible to others.
    However, administrators can still see your real username, to assist with
    account related issues.
</p>

<p>
    If you set your profile to Public, then visitors and members will be able to
    see your username and user page.
