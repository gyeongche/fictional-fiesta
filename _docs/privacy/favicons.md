<p>
    Within <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo Search</a> we show favicons (small website logos) for a better user experience. These favicons are requested from our servers rather than from websites directly, because it can be surprisingly complicated to locate a favicon for a website — they can be stored in a variety of locations and in a variety of formats. We've developed our behind-the-scenes service to understand these edge cases and simplify retrieval within our app and search engine.

<p>
    At DuckDuckGo, we do not collect or share personal information — that's our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">privacy policy</a> in a nutshell — so naturally we designed the favicon service with privacy as the priority. The image requests are encrypted over the wire using the same ciphers as your DuckDuckGo searches and, as with all our services, adhere to our strict privacy policy in that the requests are anonymous and do not collect or share any personal information.
