    At DuckDuckGo, we do not collect or share any personal information. That's our
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">privacy policy</a> in a nutshell. For
    example, we do not store IP addresses in our server logs, and we do not create
    unique cookies. As such, we do not even have the ability to create search
    histories or search sessions for any individual — privacy by design.
</p>

<p>
    At the same time, searchers often need accurate location-based results like
    local weather and restaurants. Interestingly, we can actually serve localized
    instant answers (<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=weather&amp;ia=weather">for things like the weather</a>) while
    still keeping you completely anonymous, in accordance with our strict
    privacy policy.
</p>

<p>
    To do so, we approximate location information using a GEO::IP lookup. This
    process does not expose any personally identifiable information like IP
    addresses to third parties, and in accordance with our strict privacy policy,
    DuckDuckGo does not store the IP address once it’s been used to approximate
    your location. In fact, since the IP address is automatically sent to us via
    your browser request, this process does not need to request any additional
    information than what you are already sending.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, this process is not always accurate enough, especially on
    mobile phone networks that route traffic through a central hub, making you
    appear to us to be hundreds of miles away from where you actually are! To get
    around this issue and improve the location accuracy of search results, you may
    see a prompt asking you if you’d like to opt-in to share your current location
    with DuckDuckGo.

<p>
    Major web browsers have access to more accurate location information using a
    variety of techniques, including WiFi databases, cell tower location
    databases, and GPS. When you see one of these common browser prompts, you are
    allowing your browser to share this more accurate location with the requesting
    site.

<p>
    When you allow DuckDuckGo to use this information, the location returned by the browser is stored locally on your device and is never sent to our servers. The       next time you perform a search on DuckDuckGo.com like "restaurants near me," code that runs locally in your browser hides your actual location from DuckDuckGo       and sends us a random location nearby instead. This is all we need to get you better nearby results. The outcome is that DuckDuckGo never sees your actual           location.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>To be clear, that means that even if you opt-in to sharing a more accurate
        location, your searches will still be completely anonymous.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    That said, as mentioned above, your browser uses a variety of techniques to
    identify an accurate location, which may present additional privacy
    implications. These implications vary by browser and depend on which location
    service it uses. Most major browsers provide detailed information on the
    location service they use and their associated policies:
