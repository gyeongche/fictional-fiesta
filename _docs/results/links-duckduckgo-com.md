    At DuckDuckGo, we do not collect or share any personal information. That's our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">privacy policy</a> in a nutshell. For example, we do not store IP addresses, and we do not create unique cookies. As such, we do not even have the ability to create search histories or search sessions for any individual — privacy by design.

    When using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo Search</a>, you may notice network requests to links.duckduckgo.com. For stability, privacy and security we compartmentalize parts of our infrastructure, including on DuckDuckGo Search. We use JavaScript to fetch organic results, and that code is hosted on a dedicated subdomain – links.duckduckgo.com – using end-to-end encryption (TLS). This process is anonymous.
