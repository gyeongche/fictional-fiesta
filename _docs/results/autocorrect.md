<p>
    Our intention is to not autocorrect searches. That is, we intend to completely
    respect the query you type in, and (in some cases) display a
    <em>Did you mean?</em> link at the top when relevant.
</p>

<p>
    However, there are a few outstanding major bugs in this area that we are
    working to resolve. As a result, you may see some autocorrect behavior in the
    search results.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, these bugs involve a bunch of APIs that are mostly out of our
    control. We are both working around these bugs and also working to get them
    fixed .

<p>
    For some queries, it has been a little slow to resolve, but rest assured that
    this is a top priority. In any case, specific examples always help as we may
    be able to easily add more workarounds.
