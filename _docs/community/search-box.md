    You can integrate the DuckDuckGo search box to search your site using
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/search_box">this wizard</a>.
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160623174219/http://hardik.org/blog/stylising-duckduckgo-site-search/">There's a great writeup on how to change the style of that box over
        here (archived).</a>

<p>
    If you'd like to add a handy search box that simply searches DuckDuckGo
    through your page, you can add this code to your site:
</p>

```html
<form method="get" action="https://duckduckgo.com/">
    <input size="40" name="q">
    <input type="submit" value="Search">
</form>
```

<p>
