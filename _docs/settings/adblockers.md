<h3>Support DuckDuckGo by disabling ad blockers on our page:</h3>

Many DuckDuckGo users opt for ad-blocking software and browser extensions, like
Adblock Plus, that prevent our advertisements from displaying. We understand and
respect your decision to limit exposure to advertising, which is why DuckDuckGo
allows users to disable ads through our
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/settings">Settings menu</a> (under the General
tab &gt; Advertisements).

Because of our belief in a better search experience with less clutter, our ads
have always been extremely minimal, unintrusive, and clearly marked as different
than the other results (they always have an Ad badge).

Further, our ads should be relevant to your search, as they're meant to be
helpful. If you see a bad ad,
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/feedback">let us know!</a>
