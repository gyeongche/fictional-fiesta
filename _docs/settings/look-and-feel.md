    You can change a lot of the look and feel (fonts, colors, sizes, etc) of

    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/settings">settings page</a>, which you can
    also access on search result pages via the menu at the top right. These
    settings can also be set via
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/params">URL parameters</a> (using no cookies).
