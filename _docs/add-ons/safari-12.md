<h2>Safari 12 Update</h2>

<p>The Safari 12 desktop browser moved to a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_app_extensions" target="_blank">new model</a> for browser extensions that offers users greater security and performance. It also meant that our original extension was no longer compatible, but with Safari 13 new functionality was thankfully added that enabled us to bring it back. Consequently, our DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials extension is once again available to desktop Safari users, although note you'll need Safari 13+ on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or newer to install the updated version.</p>
    
<p>Due to the changes in Safari, we unfortunately had to remove DuckDuckGo Smarter Encryption (our technology for enforcing secure website connections), but we are hopeful to restore this functionality to Safari as well soon. We were, however, able to increase our tracker blocking coverage, and enhance the user interface for a better overall extension experience.</p>

<p>You can get <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duckduckgo-privacy-essentials/id1482920575">DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials for Safari here</a>, and see our <a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/desktop/safari/">help page for installation instructions</a>. In addition to Safari, the extension is also available for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg" target="_blank">Chrome, Brave and Vivaldi</a>, with the full suite of privacy features.</p>
