    We've recently discovered some malicious Chrome extensions, often with the
    word "video" in the name, are incorrectly sending searches to DuckDuckGo and
    Bing. Some of the names we've seen are "My Video Grid", "Video Tips", and "My
    Vital Video".
    <strong>DuckDuckGo is in no way affiliated with these extensions</strong>.
    However, we would like to help you resolve this issue. Below are instructions
    on how to remove such extensions:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open Google Chrome.</li>

    <li>
        Click on the "More" button in the top right of your browser (it looks like
        three vertical dots).
        <br />
        <img alt="Screenshot of 'More' button in Chrome browser" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/206551aff3031c8cf9f13ff7faa371da.png" />
    </li>

    <li>
        Highlight "More Tools" and click on "Extensions".
        <br />
        <img alt="Screenshot of the 'Extensions' option in the 'More Tools' menu" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/bbd144b87e15f3d3c73cff6e80111db7.png" />
    </li>

    <li>
        Find the extension called "My Video Grid" and click the trash can on the
        right.
        <br />
        <img alt="Screenshot showing the extensions list" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fe52f1f957b13e62863e9a35751c710e.png" />
    </li>

    <li>
        A new window will be displayed, check the "Report Abuse" box and then click
        "Remove".
        <br />
        <img alt="Screenshot showing the 'Report Abuse' checkbox" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/9e9e45402c08135c09bfb54984b9f33f.png" />
    </li>

    <li>
        Another window will be displayed, select "Malware / Can't Uninstall" and
        then click "Submit".
        <br />
        <img alt="Screenshot showing the abuse report form." src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/05562b93d03e75e9519af09faea2c02b.png" />
    </li>

    <p>The extension will now be removed.</p>
