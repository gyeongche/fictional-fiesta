<p>
    If you want to send someone a search and be a bit circumspect about it, try a
    Let Me DuckDuckGo That For You (LMDDGTFY) website, like
    <a href="https://lmddgtfy.net/">this one.</a>
</p>

<p>
    Based on the popular
    <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/">Let Me Google That For You</a> website, the first
    LMDDGTFY was created by Michael Stephens in 2010. While Mr. Stephens no longer
    maintains a LMDDGTFY, his former website's code is
    <a href="http://github.com/mikejs/lmddgtfy/">open source</a>.
</p>

<p>
    As an alternative, Michael Yanovich has created
    <a href="http://lmddgtfy.net">LMDDGTFY.net</a>, which is also
    <a href="https://github.com/myano/lmddgtfy">open source</a>.
